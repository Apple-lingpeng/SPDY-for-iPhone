- Close all connections on reachability change.
 - Or close the connection when all CFReadStreams are closed for
   a given host.  This is like HTTP where the client needs to hold
   on to a stream reference to keep a connection alive.  It's messy
   but it works.
- Pass in a timeout to SPDY:fetch.
- Write tests for SpdySession
- Convert spdycat demo to use libSPDY.a

The following are some of the next steps to be able to create a library
and use it in ASI HTTP.
- Return a ReadStream (Actually NSInputStream)for a given NSURL
- Return an HTTP ReadStream when NPN fails to negotiate spdy.
- Take an HTTPMessage as input as well as NSURLs
 - Add a test for multiple headers with the same key.
- Reuse connections to the same hosts when there is an active request on it.
- Keep connections open for a bit of time after all active requests are
 done
