- Pass in a timeout to SPDY:fetch.
- Make the connect asynchronous.
- SpdySession should keep track of the connection status.
- SpdySession will need a list of pending SpdyStreams to
  send when a connection is established.

- Write tests for SpdySession

The following are some of the next steps to be able to create a library
and use it in ASI HTTP.
- Return a ReadStream (Actually NSInputStream)for a given NSURL
- Return an HTTP ReadStream when NPN fails to negotiate spdy.
- Take an HTTPMessage as input as well as NSURLs
 - Add a test for multiple headers with the same key.
- Reuse connections to the same hosts when there is an active request on it.
- Keep connections open for a bit of time after all active requests are
 done
