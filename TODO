The following are some of the next steps to be able to create a library
and use it in ASI HTTP.
- Return a ReadStream for a given NSURL
- Return an HTTP ReadStream when NPN fails to negotiate spdy.
- Take an HTTPMessage as input as well as NSURLs
- Reuse connections to the same hosts when there is an active request on it.
- Keep connections open for a bit of time after all active requests are
 done
