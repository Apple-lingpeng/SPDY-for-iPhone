- Close all connections on reachability change.
 - Or close the connection when all CFReadStreams are closed for
   a given host.  This is like HTTP where the client needs to hold
   on to a stream reference to keep a connection alive.  It's messy
   but it works.
- Pass in a timeout to SPDY:fetch.
- Write tests for SpdySession

The following are some of the next steps to be able to create a library
and use it in ASI HTTP.
- Return an HTTP ReadStream when NPN fails to negotiate spdy.
 - Or allow ASI HTTP to keep track of which domains support SPDY.
