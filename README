This is a project to build an easy to use SPDY library for the iPhone.

The following external libraries are used:
- spindly
- openssl (Included until Apple releases iOS with an NPN enabled OpenSSL)

The external libraries are pulled in through git submodules.

Another potential spdy library is https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/spdylay
